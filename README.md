## Purpose and Goals
The purpose of this project is to simulate a real-world phenomenon by creating a synthesized dataset using Python. The chosen phenomenon should be measurable, and the dataset should consist of at least one hundred data points across a minimum of four different variables. The project focuses on investigating the types of variables, their likely distributions, and their relationships.

## Dependencies
- NumPy (version 1.23.5)
- Pandas (version 2.1.1)
- Matplotlib (version 3.8.1)
- Seaborn (version 0.13.0)
